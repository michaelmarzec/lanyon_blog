When analysts, media members, and fans discuss the average age of an NBA team, they often lack nuance. Typically, it’s a reference like “Team X is the 5th youngest team in the NBA” and that marker is a result of a quick average of every member of the roster. In my opinion, this fails to convey an accurate representation as that average is skewed by low usage and end-of-bench players.
